[1st solution: enumeration](1.c) time complexity $O(N^2)$, space complexity $O(1)$

[2rd solution: hash](1_hash.c) 

## length of arr

different result when we call `sizeof(arr)/sizeof(int)` if:
    - `int *arr`, then `sizeof(arr)` equals to the length of a pointer, which is 8bytes
    - `int arr[]`, then we get the length of array

## return a pointer defined in the function

remember that a variable defined inside the function cannot survive outside the scope of function, therefore:
    - use `malloc` to alloct memory chunk in advance
    - use `static` to decorate the variable. Seperate the declaration and initialization if want to clear the variable the next time the function is called
    - use `global`
